Previous versions of Ghost do not support external storage solutions.\n\n**PLEASE** create an issue if you have any problems.\n\nFancy stuff** is not currently supported\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 0.6em;\">\n**Cloudinary has some \"advanced configuration options\" for Pro users and etc.. that this module does not currently handle.\n\n# To Use\n\nNote: There are some funky folder-renaming steps here due to the way that Ghost wants it's storage directory structure to be\n\n\n## NPM Installation Method\n\n1. Navigate to Ghost's `content` directory and run `npm install ghost-cloudinary-store --prefix ./`\n\n2. Rename the `node_modules` directory that is created to `storage`\n\n3. Follow the instructions below for [editing config.js][1]\n\n\n## Git Installation Method\n\nNote: The `master` branch reflects what is published on NPM\n\n1. Navigate to Ghost's `content` directory and create a directory called `storage`\n\n2. Navigate into this new `storage` directory and run `git clone https://github.com/sethbrasile/ghost-cloudinary-store.git`\n\n3. Navigate into `ghost-cloudinary-store` and run `npm install`\n\n4. Follow the instructions below for [editing config.js][1]\n\n## Editing config.js\n\nIn Ghost's `config.js` (the file where you set your URL, mail settings, etc..) add a block to whichever environment you're using (`production`, `development`, etc...) as follows:\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 0.6em;\">\nNote: These values can be obtained from your Cloudinary management console.\n\n```javascript\nstorage: {\n    active: 'ghost-cloudinary-store',\n    'ghost-cloudinary-store': {\n        cloud_name: 'yourCloudName',\n        api_key: 'yourApiKey',\n        api_secret: 'yourApiSecret'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere's a full example:\n\n```javascript\ndevelopment: {\n    url: 'http://localhost:2368',\n    storage: {\n        active: 'ghost-cloudinary-store',\n        'ghost-cloudinary-store': {\n            cloud_name: 'xxxxxxx',\n            api_key: 'xxxxxxx',\n            api_secret: 'xxxxxxxx'\n        }\n    },\n    database: {\n        client: 'sqlite3',\n        connection: {\n            filename: path.join(__dirname, '/content/data/ghost-dev.db')\n        },\n        debug: false\n    },\n    server: {\n        // Host to be passed to node's `net.Server#listen()`\n        host: '127.0.0.1',\n        // Port to be passed to node's `net.Server#listen()`, for iisnode set this to `process.env.PORT`\n        port: '2368'\n    },\n    paths: {\n        contentPath: path.join(__dirname, '/content/')\n    }\n},\n```\n\n[1]: #editing-configjs\n",
